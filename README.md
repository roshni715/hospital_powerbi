 
### 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard – Power BI Project  

#### 📌 **Problem Statement**  
Managing an emergency room (ER) is a challenging task that requires real-time monitoring of patient flow, wait times, and resource allocation. Inefficiencies in patient management can lead to increased wait times, overcrowding, and reduced patient satisfaction.  

The primary challenges include:  
- **High wait times** leading to patient dissatisfaction.  
- **Resource allocation inefficiencies** due to unclear peak hours and patient flow patterns.  
- **Lack of real-time insights** on patient demographics, admission trends, and referrals.  
- **Manual decision-making** instead of data-driven optimizations.  

To address these issues, I developed a **Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard** using Power BI, which provides real-time and historical insights into ER operations.

### 🔍 **Solution & Project Overview**  
This Power BI dashboard is designed to provide hospital administrators and decision-makers with an intuitive, data-driven approach to monitor emergency room performance.  

By analyzing key metrics such as patient wait times, satisfaction scores, admission rates, and peak hours, this dashboard enables **efficient hospital resource management, improved patient care, and data-driven decision-making**.  

#### **Key Features & Metrics Tracked**  
✅ **Real-Time & Historical Data Analysis** – Monitor ER operations on a **monthly** and **consolidated** level.  
✅ **Wait Time Optimization** – Identify trends in wait times and take action to reduce delays.  
✅ **Admission & Referral Tracking** – Understand which patients are admitted, not admitted, or referred to other departments.  
✅ **Patient Demographics & Peak Hours** – Breakdown of patients by **age, race, and busiest time slots** to optimize staffing and resource allocation.  
✅ **Satisfaction Score Monitoring** – Track patient feedback trends and identify areas for improvement.
